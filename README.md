# Data_Science_MIT

This repository contains all my work from the Applied Data Science program from MIT plus a natural language processing project that I think fits nicely with these projects.

Each of these projects was used to implement methods learned from lectures. Each one starts with exploratory data analysis, and applies some kind of clustering or modeling, and ends with conclusions that I draw from my analysis.

Data for each project is included within each of the folders.
